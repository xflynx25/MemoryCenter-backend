1. As we grow, we will need to consider sharding and rethink database
2. Should organize more along lines of fault seperation
3. Webauthn 
4. When users leave, right now all their data will die. We can offer them to alow for owner transfership, or farm donation, where anyone could 
    pluck it and take responsibility. But...if they were only user, once they leave, ok it is still owned by death (user -1).
