setup in the readme is pretty good here

the settings folder had lots of little traps
the environment variables need to be set even if not accessed 
cors is still complicated to implement
as usual, if using ios or android simulator need to change the endpoint (on frontend)

in general though, basically just using the commands from commands.txt

trailing slashes matter
